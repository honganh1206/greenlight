# User Activation

What we will do:

1. When there is a new user registration, create a secured random activation token
2. Hash this token in a new `token` table
3. Send this token (unhashed version) to the welcome email
4. Users submit the token to the `PUT /v1/users/activated` endpoint
5. Update the `activated` status in the `users` table to true
6. Remove the activation token

Notes on the `tokens` table:

- The `hash` column will store a SHA-256 **hash** of the activation token, not the token itself
- The `user_id` column will have a foreign key constraint to the `users` table.
- We also use `ON DELETE CASCADE` to tell PostgreSQL to _automatically delete all records for a user_ in the `tokens` table if the parent record gets deleted
- We only set a **short** expiry time for values in the `expiry` column, but long enough for the users to use it
- The `scope` column denotes the **purpose** of the token. This will be later used for **authorization tokens**

## Activation token

The token should be generated by a _cryptographiically secure random number generator_ (CSPRNG) and has enough _randomness_ that is impossible to guess

## Sending activation tokens

Two reasons why we instruct users to activate by issuing a `PUT` request instead of clicking on a link:

1. We do not use `GET` since it should only be used to fetch resources
2. The user's web browser or antivirus will pre-fetch the link URL in the background, inadvertently activating the account
